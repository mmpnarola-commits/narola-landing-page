## [Unreleased]

### 2026-09-07 — T029: Modernize UI theme (same color palette)
#### Changed
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`: primary variant is now a gradient (Interactive Blue →
  its darker hover shade `#005fb8`) with a soft colored shadow and a subtle hover lift.
  Both gradient stops individually pass WCAG AA against white text, so this introduces no
  contrast regression. Radius increased from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-xl`.
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`: sticky header now uses a frosted-glass effect
  (`backdrop-blur-md` + translucent white) once scrolled, instead of a flat white
  background with just a shadow. Desktop nav links gained an animated underline on hover.
  Hamburger button and mobile menu items softened to `rounded-xl` with hover backgrounds.
- `src/components/sections/CeoMessage.tsx`: added two low-opacity decorative blurred accents
  (Brand Blue and Accent Orange, both `aria-hidden`, purely visual) and gave the photo
  container a white card treatment with shadow/ring instead of a bare cropped image.

#### Fixed
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`: the CTA button had reverted to a solid Brand Blue
  (`#0084ff`) background with white text — reintroducing the exact ~3.65:1 WCAG AA contrast
  failure T004 identified and Interactive Blue exists to fix. Replaced with the shared
  `Button` component (now carrying the new gradient treatment).
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`: replaced several off-palette arbitrary hex values that
  were near-duplicates of actual theme tokens — `bg-[#f4f7fb]` → `bg-surface-muted`,
  `bg-[#bdc8d4]` (social icons) → `bg-slate/30`, `border-slate-100` (Tailwind's own default
  gray scale, not this project's token) → `border-slate/10`. Rating cards upgraded from
  `rounded-xl`/`shadow-xs` to `rounded-2xl` with a layered shadow and hover elevation.

#### Notes
- No new colors were introduced anywhere — every change above uses the same 6 tokens
  already defined in `globals.css`'s `@theme` block.
- Validated with `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` (all clean) and manual
  browser verification (visual screenshots plus computed-style checks confirming exact
  token values render correctly).
- **Flagged, not addressed** (out of scope for a styling-only task): the footer's Clutch
  4.9 / Google 4.2 rating scores and the CEO message's "20 years of experience" line are
  exactly the statistics `PRODUCTION_SITE_ANALYSIS.md` §3 identified as unverified and not
  to reuse without explicit confirmation. These were introduced in the T013 work (built
  outside this session) and were not touched here — see `AI_WORK_LOG.md`'s T029 entry.

### 2026-09-07 — T007: Header
#### Added
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — the site header: logo (linking home), simplified
  in-page anchor navigation (Services/Technologies/Industries), primary CTA, hamburger menu
  with a full-width mobile panel (same links + CTA), and a scroll-triggered shadow. Sticky
  positioned, 64px mobile / 72px desktop, per VISUAL_DIRECTION.md §5.
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` — reusable primary/secondary button, using Interactive Blue
  (not Brand Blue) specifically to satisfy the WCAG AA contrast fix from VISUAL_DIRECTION.md
  §2/T004.
- `src/components/ui/Container.tsx` — reusable 1280px max-width wrapper with responsive
  horizontal padding, per VISUAL_DIRECTION.md §4.

#### Fixed
- `src/app/globals.css`: wrapped the base element defaults (`body`, `a`, `a:hover`,
  `:focus-visible`) in `@layer base`. They were previously unlayered CSS, which — per
  Tailwind v4's cascade-layer rules — gave them unconditional priority over *any* Tailwind
  utility class regardless of specificity. This silently broke any component's ability to
  override the default link color (discovered while visually testing the Header's mobile
  nav links, which rendered blue instead of the intended Ink color even with an explicit
  `text-ink` class). No visual change to already-correct pages; this only affects
  components that explicitly override these defaults, like the new Header.

#### Changed
- `src/app/page.tsx`: temporarily renders `<Header />` above the placeholder content so it
  could be visually verified in a browser. Full page assembly/ordering is still T014's job.

#### Notes
- Validated with `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` (all clean) and manual
  browser verification at mobile and desktop widths, including exercising the mobile menu
  toggle and confirming computed colors match the design tokens.
- The primary CTA still points at the placeholder `#footer` anchor from T005 — unresolved
  until the footer exists (T013) and/or the real CTA destination is decided.

### 2026-09-07 — T006: Finalize assets
#### Added
- `public/images/logo/narola-infotech-logo.svg` — official brand logo, sourced directly
  from the production site (the company's own brand mark).
- `public/images/hero/hero-graphic.svg` — hand-authored abstract illustration in brand
  colors, used in place of photography for the hero section.
- `public/images/industries/*.svg` — 12 hand-authored, generic (non-trademarked) line icons,
  one per industry, in Interactive Blue.
- `logo`/`image` fields added to `src/content/siteConfig.ts`/`hero.ts`, and an `icon` field
  added to each entry in `src/content/industries.ts`, wiring the content layer to these new
  asset paths.

#### Notes
- Three sourcing decisions were confirmed with the human before creating anything: reuse the
  official logo SVG (vs. a text wordmark), use an abstract graphic instead of photography for
  the hero (vs. reusing the production photo or omitting imagery), and hand-author icons
  with zero new dependencies (vs. adding an icon-library package).
- **No technology icon/logo assets were created.** Recreating 14 trademarked technology
  logos (React, Angular, PHP, etc.) by hand from memory risked inaccurate, unauthorized-
  looking derivatives, and `technologies.ts` already fully identifies each technology by
  name — duplicating that as image assets would duplicate content across layers for no
  benefit. `technologies.ts` documents that the Technologies section (T011) should render
  these as text/wordmark badges instead.
- Total new asset weight: ~28KB across all files (all SVG, no raster images) — consistent
  with VISUAL_DIRECTION.md's performance principles.
- No components were built; content files were updated only to add asset-path fields, not
  new copy.

### 2026-09-07 — T005: Finalize content mapping
#### Added
- `src/content/hero.ts` — hero eyebrow, headline, and trust-point copy.
- `src/content/transformationIntro.ts` — "Accelerate Your Business Transformation..."
  section heading and body copy.
- `src/content/footer.ts` — the four office locations (North Carolina, Virginia, Surat,
  Nashik) with full addresses.

#### Changed
- Populated `src/content/navigation.ts` with the three simplified in-page anchor nav items
  (Services, Technologies, Industries) per VISUAL_DIRECTION.md §5.
- Populated `src/content/siteConfig.ts` with the finalized tagline, a real meta description,
  and the primary CTA label/href (see Notes).
- Populated `src/content/services.ts` with the 4 core service categories (each with a
  paraphrased description and sub-service labels) and the 6 "Other Services" labels.
- Populated `src/content/technologies.ts` with 4 confirmed technology categories (Front End,
  Back End, Mobile, CMS) and their technology names.
- Populated `src/content/industries.ts` with the full 12-industry list.

#### Notes
- All content sourced from `PRODUCTION_SITE_ANALYSIS.md`'s explicitly retained/factual
  content only. Multi-sentence copy (transformation intro, service descriptions) was
  paraphrased, not copied verbatim, per CLAUDE.md. None of the flagged unverified statistics,
  client names, testimonials, or review scores were reused.
- Open item: the primary CTA (`siteConfig.primaryCta.href`) currently points to a same-page
  footer anchor as a placeholder — this project has no contact page/form in v1 scope, and the
  final destination (mailto, an embedded form, or an external link) is still an open decision.
- Technology sub-categories with no confirmed tool names on the production site (Database,
  DevOps and Cloud, Project Management) were intentionally omitted rather than guessed.
- No components were built or modified — content/data files only.

### 2026-09-07 — T028: Global typography & base styling
#### Added
- Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens in `src/app/globals.css` for the finalized brand palette
  (`--color-brand-blue`, `--color-interactive-blue`, `--color-ink`, `--color-slate`,
  `--color-accent-orange`, `--color-surface-muted`) and typography scale (`--text-h1`/
  `-h1-lg`, `--text-h2`/`-h2-lg`, `--text-h3`, `--text-h4`, `--text-body`, `--text-small`,
  `--text-button`, each with a paired line-height), per VISUAL_DIRECTION.md §2–3.
- Global base styles: body background (white) and text color (Dark Ink), default link
  color/underline behavior (Interactive Blue), a visible `:focus-visible` outline, and a
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` safeguard collapsing animation/transition durations.
- Inter font wired up in `src/app/layout.tsx` via `next/font/google` (replacing the default
  `create-next-app` Geist/Geist Mono fonts), with `display: "swap"` and a generic
  system-font fallback chain.

#### Changed
- Removed the scaffolded `prefers-color-scheme: dark` auto-switch and its `--background`/
  `--foreground` variable indirection from `globals.css` — VISUAL_DIRECTION.md defines a
  single fixed light-mode design with no dark variant, so the untouched framework
  boilerplate was replaced with an explicit `color-scheme: light` and direct body colors.
- Removed the unused Geist Mono font (no monospace text exists anywhere on this project).

#### Notes
- Documentation-only change plus global CSS/font wiring — no Header, Hero, or section
  component was built or modified. `src/app/page.tsx` is unchanged.
- All new Tailwind utilities were verified to compile correctly (confirmed via a temporary,
  reverted test usage) — they don't appear in the production CSS yet because nothing
  references them until component tasks (T007+) do, which is expected Tailwind v4 tree-shaking.
- Validated with `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` — all clean.

### 2026-09-07 — T004: Visual direction
#### Added
- `VISUAL_DIRECTION.md` — finalized design system covering brand colors, typography,
  layout/spacing, header/hero direction, per-section design language, reusable UI (cards,
  buttons, icons), imagery guidelines, responsive breakpoints, accessibility requirements,
  and performance principles, for future implementation tasks (T007+) to follow.

#### Notes
- Introduced one supporting UI color, Interactive Blue (`#0072D9`), alongside the existing
  brand palette — used only for button/link text where white or light text needs WCAG AA
  contrast, directly resolving the button-contrast failure (~3.65:1) computed in T003.
  Computed contrast ratios for every color pairing used are included in the document.
- No landing-page components (Header, Hero, section components, or `ui/` primitives) were
  created or modified. No code files were changed — documentation only.
- No new dependencies were added; no framework/architecture changes were made.

### 2026-09-07 — T003: Production website analysis
#### Added
- `PRODUCTION_SITE_ANALYSIS.md` — structured reference analysis of
  https://www.narolainfotech.com/, covering overall page structure, brand colors/typography,
  content inventory (with verified facts clearly separated from unverified production-site
  claims), navigation structure, technical stack observations, SEO/accessibility findings
  (including computed WCAG color-contrast ratios), and landing-page-specific recommendations.

#### Notes
- Documentation/reference only — no landing-page UI, components, or code was added.
- No WordPress markup, CSS, or code was copied; the production site was not modified.
- No statistics, awards, client names, or testimonials from the production site were adopted
  as claims for the new landing page — they are explicitly flagged as reference-only in the
  analysis document.

### 2026-09-07 — T002: Project documentation
#### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — project purpose, technology, development/design/git rules, and AI workflow.
- `TASKS.md` — full project task checklist (T001–T026) covering foundation, design/content,
  layout sections, quality, and deployment phases.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `AI_WORK_LOG.md` — structured log of AI-assisted development effort.

### 2026-09-07 — T001: Next.js project initialization
#### Added
- Initialized Next.js project directly in the repository root (no nested project folder).
- Next.js `16.3.4` (App Router, `src/` directory layout, `@/*` import alias).
- React `19.2.8` / React DOM `19.2.8`.
- TypeScript `^5`, with strict mode enabled.
- Tailwind CSS `^4` (CSS-first configuration via `@tailwindcss/postcss`).
- ESLint `^9` with `eslint-config-next` (core-web-vitals + typescript configs).
- Minimal placeholder home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) and root layout
  (`src/app/layout.tsx`) — no landing-page sections implemented.

#### Changed
- Local Node.js version upgraded from `v18.12.1` to `v24.20.0` (LTS) via `nvm`, since
  Next.js 14/15/16 all require a Node.js minimum above what was previously installed.

#### Removed
- Default `create-next-app` placeholder assets (`next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `globe.svg`,
  `file.svg`, `window.svg`) that are no longer referenced after simplifying the placeholder
  page.

#### Validated
- `npm run build` — succeeded, static prerender of `/` and `/_not-found`.
- `npm run lint` — passed with no errors or warnings.
- `npm run dev` — verified in-browser; placeholder page rendered correctly with no console
  errors.

#### Notes
- No landing-page sections (Header, Hero, Services, Technologies, Industries, Footer) were
  implemented in this milestone — foundation only.
- The existing production WordPress website was not modified.
